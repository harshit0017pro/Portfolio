That’s a **fantastic project idea**! Building your own chatbot from scratch with custom personal data will help you:

- **Learn key AI, JS, and web development skills** (NLP, APIs, front-end/backend integration)
- **Showcase your talent** to recruiters/friends (as a live portfolio feature)
- **Stand out** with a unique, personalized chatbot on your site

**How to proceed:**

1. **Backend:**
   - Start with a simple Python or Node.js server.
   - Store Q&A pairs or info about yourself (maybe in a JSON file or database).
   - Use basic logic (or simple NLP libraries) to answer questions about you.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Create a chatbox UI (can use pure HTML/CSS/JS or React).
   - Connect to your backend via AJAX/fetch.
   - Display incoming and outgoing messages.

3. **Integration:**
   - Host your backend (try **Vercel**, **Netlify Functions**, or **Render** for free serverless backends).
   - When you deploy your site, just include the frontend code+widget and connect to your API endpoint.

**To integrate the bot** in your deployed portfolio:
- Add the chat widget code to your main HTML file.
- Make sure CORS is enabled on your backend for public site use.

**Extra touches:**
- Add your resume, project info, fun facts, skills, etc. to the bot’s data.
- Style UI to match portfolio aesthetics.

This will be a very impressive project for your AI/Web Dev portfolio!
